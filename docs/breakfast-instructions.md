# Welcome

Hello Armando and Mom! I hope you both are having a good morning. I am
sorry that I am unable to be with you guys to give a tour of the new
apartment, but I have written a guide to help you so that you can
navigate the kitchen to make breakfast. This guide provides multiple
recipes for you to pick from that use the kitchen equipment and food
that is currently available in the apartment. The recipes were made with
both of you in mind. Armando, being that you are vegan, I have included
two recipes for dishes that you can enjoy which are the vegan French
toast and the avocado on toast. These are easy to make and follow so
that you can make breakfast while also getting accustomed to the new
apartment. Mom, I have included some recipes that are here for you that
are not vegan, which is the omelet and the pancakes. I know that you are
all too familiar with these dishes so you will not need them, but this
guide should help you find all the things needed for the recipe. Have a
wonderful time cooking breakfast at the apartment using this guide to
help!

# How to Navigate the kitchen

The first thing that you will need to know to make breakfast is where
everything is in the kitchen. To help you navigate, I will tell you
where all the kitchen essentials are located. In the apartment, the
equipment and food are in one of five separate places: refrigerator,
pantry, top cabinet, lower cabinet, or drawer. Each place contains
different kitchen tools or food items and are organized in such a way to
make it easy for you to find.

## Refrigerator

The refrigerator is located on the left side of the kitchen (Figure 1)
and stores all essential groceries that need to be refrigerated like
eggs, milk, etc.

Remember to put back any ingredients from the refrigerator back after
you are done using them, so they do not spoil.

## Pantry

The pantry is located on the right side of the kitchen (Figure 2) and
contains other food items that do not need to be refrigerated like
flour, snacks, etc.

Be careful when grabbing items from the pantry so that you do not knock
any items down.

## Top Cabinet

This is the furthest right cabinet located above the counter and to the
left of the pantry (Figure 3). This cabinet contains dishes, cups, as
well as oil and spices that are often used when cooking.

## Bottom Cabinet

This cabinet is in line with the top cabinet, but it is below the
counter (Figure 4) and contains larger kitchen utensils like mixing
bowls, pots, pans, etc.

## Drawer

This is located in between the top and bottom cabinet and next to the
pantry (Figure 5). This drawer contains all utensils like forks, spoons,
knives, spatulas, etc.

# How to Decide What to Make

Now that you both know a little bit more about the layout of the
kitchen, you guys must pick what to make. I have included 4 recipes to
choose from covering a variety of breakfast options. The first two
recipes I chose with Mom in the back of my head as they are things you
made a lot throughout your life and are dishes that you enjoy. The first
recipe that I chose was pancakes. Pancakes are a fantastic way to start
the morning and are not difficult to make with most of the process
involving measuring and mixing ingredients together. The second recipe
that I provided was a veggie omelet. This dish is super healthy with
protein and vegetables to start the day out right. However, these two
recipes are not vegan as they both contain animal products with milk and
eggs.

Keeping this in mind, I have also provided two vegan recipes for Armando
as they fit in with your diet. The first vegan recipe I have provided is
for vegan French toast. Coming from Mozambique, I wanted to give you
something that you may have never tried before. French toast is bread
soaked in a custard mixture which is then pan fried. It is a little more
advanced, and as you are not the most experienced cook, the other recipe
I have provided is much simpler. The next vegan recipe is avocado on
toast. Avocados are delicious and nutritious so adding a few simple
ingredients to it and putting it on toast is a great and efficient way
to start your day.

With these different options, hopefully you guys can cook something that
you will enjoy. If you both want something a little more filling, opt
for the pancakes and French toast. If you want something a little
lighter and healthier, choose the veggie omelet and avocado toast.
Whichever choice you both make, have fun making it in the new apartment
and I wish you both the best of luck.
