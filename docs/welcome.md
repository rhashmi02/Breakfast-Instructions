# Welcome

Hello Armando and Mom! I hope you both are having a good morning. I am
sorry that I am unable to be with you guys to give a tour of the new
apartment, but I have written a guide to help you so that you can
navigate the kitchen to make breakfast. This guide provides multiple
recipes for you to pick from that use the kitchen equipment and food
that is currently available in the apartment. The recipes were made with
both of you in mind. Armando, being that you are vegan, I have included
two recipes for dishes that you can enjoy which are the vegan French
toast and the avocado on toast. These are easy to make and follow so
that you can make breakfast while also getting accustomed to the new
apartment. Mom, I have included some recipes that are here for you that
are not vegan, which is the omelet and the pancakes. I know that you are
all too familiar with these dishes so you will not need them, but this
guide should help you find all the things needed for the recipe. Have a
wonderful time cooking breakfast at the apartment using this guide to
help!
